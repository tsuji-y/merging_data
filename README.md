# merging_data
This repo stores several data frames for merging two (or more) datasets.
It occurs that the data you are interested in are from two different datasets and do not share its identifier. Merging these datasets is costly but not so much to get credit for. I made this repo to share my effort to help build new data by merging different datasets.
